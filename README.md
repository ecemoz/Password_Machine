## How It Works
1. Enter your website, email, and password (or generate a strong password).
2. Click **Add Password** to save the entry to `data.txt`.
3. All entries are appended to the file in table format.
4. The **Generate** button creates a strong random password and copies it to your clipboard automatically.
